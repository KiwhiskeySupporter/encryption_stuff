Unlike other repos that post a crypto app and do not ever come back for 4 years to update it... lots of thought went into this. Each dir is its own app. App code is all in main.rs ! As such it is absurdly and incredibly easy to feed to chatgpt to audit for security, check to make sure the readme is correct, or make any changes you want. One could not ask for more.
